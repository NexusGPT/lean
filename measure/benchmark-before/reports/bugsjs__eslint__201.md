Values: undefined at undefined, sha256 undefined; lane B draws its listed values first, and each certificate names the file by this hash

1 changed function(s); 3 unchanged caller(s) checked through lane B, 2 with a WITNESS through a changed callee: **0 in scope · 3 WITNESS · 0 PASS-proved · 0 PASS-decided · 0 PASS-bounded · 0 ASK · 0 REFUSE · 0 NEW**

### lib/config.js · `loadConfig`

- line 66, `var`: `var` is outside the subset; use let or const
  do: [conditional: the binding is inside a function, has one declaration, every use follows it in the same block, and no closure inside a loop captures it] Replace var with let only under the precondition. Hoisting, repeated declarations and loop closures can change the result.

A WITNESS is an input on which the two versions differ; PASS-proved is a theorem checked by Dafny; PASS-decided is a finite component explored over every event sequence; PASS-bounded is no difference found within the stated bound; ASK is undecided with its reason; REFUSE(load) names a local source linkage failure; candidate-only evaluation failures are ASK with their environment class; NEW records a standalone run and makes no equality claim.
